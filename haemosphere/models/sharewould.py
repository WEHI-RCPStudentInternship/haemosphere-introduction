ShareWould
==========

This module is for applications that *would* like to *share* files among users, groups, or even 
the general public.  (At the time I wrote this I was playing Robin Hood in "Robin Hood's Lament",
and morphed *Sherwood* for the name of this proggy.   Since Sherwood was a forest and forest has
trees, just like this involves directory trees ... get it?  Don't like it?  Sue me.   When you
come right down to it, this is really nothing more than a namespace manager that takes advantage
of some of the underlying filesystem's functions and semantics.

The Problem
-----------

We have an application that must serve collections among users, groups, and also publically.  These are
all static in the sense that, for the purposes of this application, they are read-only.   We wanted a 
simple way to let users publish their collections and still have some control over who else can see them.

The Solution
------------

A file / directory hierarchy is constructed in which collections, taking the form of files, are stored
in subdirectories allocated to individual users.    Users may then publish their collections in other users'
or groups' directories, or in the ''PUBLIC'' directory.   The act of "publishing" involves little more than
the creation of a *symbolic link* in the target directory that points back to the original file. 

Publishing
----------

Since only a user can "own" a publishable file, only a user can publish that file.   Although it is technically
feasible to publish a file in a group and then publish that group's notion (i.e. the symlink) of the file
elsewhere, creating a chain of symlinks, this begins to make managing subscriptions (see next section)
much more difficult, and it also makes control of publication a bit too loose.   Though somewhat artificial, 
publishing is therefore constrained to something only users can do, and they can do it only with files they
"own" -- i.e., that are in their own directory.  If someone in a group to which a file has been publishes wishes 
to have it published elsewhere, they need to get the owner of the file to publish it.

While ShareWould itself won't enforce this, directly, it supports it by not creating the subscription support
structures in the group or public directories; only in private, user directories.

Subscription
------------

Each file in a user's directory has a corresponding ``.sub`` file, which is nothing more than
a TAB-separated (TSV) file containing three columns: a subscriber name (or PUBLIC), a column telling whether this is
published to a private individual (user) or a group, and an alias column used to sort out namespace collisions.

These files are used to keep track of where their corresponding collection files have been published.
Thus, when the collection is removed or re-parented, the symlinks to that file can be removed or updated.
Note that there are NO such files in the public or group directories.  Again, only users can "own" or publish
files.

Permissions
-----------

Since this is intended to be used for collaboration, we're not all that fussed about permissions and who can do what.
The main idea is to keep stuff private that we don't want made public.  The assumption is that if something has
been shard, it was intended to be shared.  If something was mistakenly shared, it can always be un-shared.   

Furthermore, this module, at least in its initial form, did not take part in authorization checks.   If a method
is called, it assumes that the caller had permission to make that call, be it adding, removing, publishing, unpublishing, &c.

`user` and `group` specification are otherwise mutually exclusive.  If a ``group=`` keyword
is used, it makes no sense to specify a user, and likewise if a ``user=`` keyword is given.

published at the target, or ``False`` if publication fails.

Namespace Collision
-------------------

If the collection is already published in the target area then one one of two things will happen:

 *if `alternate` is ``False`` the operation will fail and the collection is not published.  ``None`` is returned. 
 * If`alternate` is ``True`` the collection will be published as the specified name with a number suffixed
   to the name.  (e.g. ``myCollection`` becomes ``myCollection.1``.)  A FINITE NUMBER of attempts will be made
   and then utter, abject failure will be declared, and the code will suck itself into a singularity
   along with all the ale on Rigel 7.  So ... be warned.
 * If `alternate is ``None``, publication fails and ``None`` is returned.
 * If `alternate` is a string (or unicode) or a number, this is suffixed to the collection name.
   If this still results in a namespace collision, publication fails and ``None`` is returned.
